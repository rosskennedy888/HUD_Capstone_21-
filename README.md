Senior Design Project 2021 Heads Up Display

Group members: Ross Kennedy, Ashley Bey, Derien Jackson, Lanutoshi Paul

This project focuses on developing a Heads Up Display that detects oncoming traffic lights and displays an appropriate warning message to the driver.

The following components are required:
- Arduino Uno
- Raspberry Pi 3B+
- GPS
- CAN-BUS Shield
- LCD Display
- Camera

The following files are included in the final system:
- Arduino_Pi_Com_TM.py
- haversine.py
- I2C_LCD_driver.py

The following files each utilize a different light detection method. These methods are not included in the final system, but are available for future testing purposes.
- SIFT_Detect.py
- ball_tracking.py
- circleDetect.py
- rgb_normalization.py
